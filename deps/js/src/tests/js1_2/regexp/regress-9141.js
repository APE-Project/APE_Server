 * Calls to AddTestCase here. AddTestCase is a function that is defined
 * in shell.js and takes three arguments:
 * - a string representation of what is being tested
 * - the expected result
 * - the actual result
 *
 * For example, a test might look like this:
 *
 * var zip = /[\d]{5}$/;
 *
 * AddTestCase(
 * "zip = /[\d]{5}$/; \"PO Box 12345 Boston, MA 02134\".match(zip)",   // description of the test
 *  "02134",                                                           // expected result
 *  "PO Box 12345 Boston, MA 02134".match(zip) );                      // actual result
