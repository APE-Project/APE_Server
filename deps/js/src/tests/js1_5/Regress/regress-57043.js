 * SUMMARY:  This test arose from Bugzilla bug 57043:
 * "Negative integers as object properties: strange behavior!"
 *
 * We check that object properties may be indexed by signed
 * numeric literals, as in assignments like obj[-1] = 'Hello' 
 *
 * NOTE: it should not matter whether we provide the literal with
 * quotes around it or not; e.g. these should be equivalent:
 *
 *                                    obj[-1]  = 'Hello'
 *                                    obj['-1']  = 'Hello'
