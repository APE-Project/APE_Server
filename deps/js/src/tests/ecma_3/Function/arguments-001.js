/*
 * Brendan:
 *
 * Note that only callee and length can be overridden, so deleting an indexed
 * property and asking for it again causes it to be recreated by args_resolve:
 *
 * function g(){delete arguments[0]; return arguments[0]}
 * g(42)     // should this print 42?
 *
 * I'm not positive this violates ECMA, which allows in chapter 16 for extensions
 * including properties (does it allow for magically reappearing properties?).  The
 * delete operator successfully deletes arguments[0] and results in true, but that
 * is not distinguishable from the case where arguments[0] was delegated to
 * Arguments.prototype[0], which was how the bad old code worked.
 *
 * I'll ponder this last detail...
 *
 * UPDATE: Per ECMA-262, delete on an arguments[i] should succeed
 * and remove that property from the arguments object, leaving any get
 * of it after the delete to evaluate to undefined.
