   File Name:          15.8.2.4.js
   ECMA Section:       15.8.2.4 atan( x )
   Description:        return an approximation to the arc tangent of the
   argument.  the result is expressed in radians and
   range is from -PI/2 to +PI/2.  special cases:
   - if x is NaN,  the result is NaN
   - if x == +0,   the result is +0
   - if x == -0,   the result is -0
   - if x == +Infinity,    the result is approximately +PI/2
   - if x == -Infinity,    the result is approximately -PI/2
