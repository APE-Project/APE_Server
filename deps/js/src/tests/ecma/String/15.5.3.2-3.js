   File Name:          15.5.3.2-1.js
   ECMA Section:       15.5.3.2  String.fromCharCode( char0, char1, ... )
   Description:        Return a string value containing as many characters
   as the number of arguments.  Each argument specifies
   one character of the resulting string, with the first
   argument specifying the first character, and so on,
   from left to right.  An argument is converted to a
   character by applying the operation ToUint16 and
   regarding the resulting 16bit integeras the Unicode
   encoding of a character.  If no arguments are supplied,
   the result is the empty string.

   This test covers Basic Latin (range U+0020 - U+007F)
