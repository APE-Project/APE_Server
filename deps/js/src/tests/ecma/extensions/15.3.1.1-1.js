   File Name:          15.3.1.1.js
   ECMA Section:       15.3.1.1 The Function Constructor Called as a Function

   Description:
   When the Function function is called with some arguments p1, p2, . . . , pn, body
   (where n might be 0, that is, there are no "p" arguments, and where body might
   also not be provided), the following steps are taken:

   1.  Create and return a new Function object exactly if the function constructor had
   been called with the same arguments (15.3.2.1).
