   File Name:          15.4.2.1-3.js
   ECMA Section:       15.4.2.1 new Array( item0, item1, ... )
   Description:        This description only applies of the constructor is
   given two or more arguments.

   The [[Prototype]] property of the newly constructed
   object is set to the original Array prototype object,
   the one that is the initial value of Array.prototype
   (15.4.3.1).

   The [[Class]] property of the newly constructed object
   is set to "Array".

   The length property of the newly constructed object is
   set to the number of arguments.

   The 0 property of the newly constructed object is set
   to item0... in general, for as many arguments as there
   are, the k property of the newly constructed object is
   set to argument k, where the first argument is
   considered to be argument number 0.

   This test stresses the number of arguments presented to
   the Array constructor.  Should support up to Math.pow
   (2,32) arguments, since that is the maximum length of an
   ECMAScript array.

   ***Change TEST_LENGTH to Math.pow(2,32) when larger array
   lengths are supported.
