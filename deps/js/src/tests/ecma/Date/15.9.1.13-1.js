   File Name:          15.9.1.13-1.js
   ECMA Section:       15.9.1.1 MakeDate(day, time)
   Description:

   The operator MakeDate calculates a number of milliseconds from its
   two arguments, which must be ECMAScript number values. This
   operator functions as follows:

   1. If day is not finite or time is not finite, return NaN.

   2. Compute day * msPerDay + time.

   3. Return Result(2).
