   ECMA Section:       7.7.3 Numeric Literals

   Description:        A numeric literal stands for a value of the Number type
   This value is determined in two steps:  first a
   mathematical value (MV) is derived from the literal;
   second, this mathematical value is rounded, ideally
   using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode, to a reprentable
   value of of the number type.
