   File Name:          expression-001.js
   Corresponds to:     ecma/Expressions/11.12-2-n.js
   ECMA Section:       11.12
   Description:

   The grammar for a ConditionalExpression in ECMAScript is a little bit
   different from that in C and Java, which each allow the second
   subexpression to be an Expression but restrict the third expression to
   be a ConditionalExpression.  The motivation for this difference in
   ECMAScript is to allow an assignment expression to be governed by either
   arm of a conditional and to eliminate the confusing and fairly useless
   case of a comma expression as the center expression.
