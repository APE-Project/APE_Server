   Section:
   Description:        Determining Instance Relationships

   This test is the same as js1_3/inherit/proto-002, except that it uses
   the builtin instanceof operator rather than a user-defined function
   called InstanceOf.

   This tests Object Hierarchy and Inheritance, as described in the document
   Object Hierarchy and Inheritance in JavaScript, last modified on 12/18/97
   15:19:34 on http://devedge.netscape.com/.  Current URL:
   http://devedge.netscape.com/docs/manuals/communicator/jsobj/contents.htm

   This tests the syntax ObjectName.prototype = new PrototypeObject using the
   Employee example in the document referenced above.
