/**
 *  File Name:          function-001.js
 *  Description:
 *
 * http://scopus.mcom.com/bugsplat/show_bug.cgi?id=324455
 *
 *  Earlier versions of JavaScript supported access to the arguments property
 *  of the function object. This property held the arguments to the function.
 *  function f() {
 *      return f.arguments[0];    // deprecated
 *  }
 *  var x = f(3);    // x will be 3
 *
 * This feature is not a part of the final ECMA standard. Instead, scripts
 * should simply use just "arguments":
 *
 * function f() {
 *    return arguments[0];    // okay
 * }
 *
 * var x = f(3);    // x will be 3
 *
 * Again, this feature was motivated by performance concerns. Access to the
 * arguments property is not threadsafe, which is of particular concern in
 * server environments. Also, the compiler can generate better code for
 * functions because it can tell when the arguments are being accessed only by
 * name and avoid setting up the arguments object.
