To run narcissus with jstests.py, make sure that js/src/njs is executable.
Then change to the js/src/tests/ directory and run the following command:

  python jstests.py -d -j 4 ../njs -m narcissus.list


The js/src/tests/narcissus directory can be used for any tweaks that might be needed
to make Narcissus work properly.  Currently, Narcissus is failing a number of
tests.  narcissus-failures.txt can be used to ignore those tests.

  python jstests.py -d -j 4 ../njs -m narcissus.list -x narcissus-failures.txt
