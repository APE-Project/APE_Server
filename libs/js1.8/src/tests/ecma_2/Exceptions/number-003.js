/**
   File Name:          number-003.js
   Corresponds To:     15.7.4.3-3.js
   ECMA Section:       15.7.4.3.1 Number.prototype.valueOf()
   Description:
   Returns this number value.

   The valueOf function is not generic; it generates a runtime error if its
   this value is not a Number object. Therefore it cannot be transferred to
   other kinds of objects for use as a method.
