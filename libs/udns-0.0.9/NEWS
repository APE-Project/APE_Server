User-visible changes in udns library.  Recent changes on top.

0.0.9 (16 Jan 2007)

 - incompat: minor API changes in dns_init() &friends.  dns_init()
   now requires extra `struct dns_ctx *' argument.  Not bumped
   soversion yet - I only expect one "release" with this change,
   0.1 will have more changes and will increment so version

 - many small bugfixes, here and there

 - more robust FORMERR replies handling - not only such replies are now
   recognized, but udns retries queries without EDNS0 extensions if tried
   with, but server reported FORMERR

 - portability changes, udns now includes getopt() implementation fo
   the systems lacking it (mostly windows), and dns_ntop()&dns_pton(),
   which are either just wrappers for system functions or reimplementations.

 - build is now based on autoconf-like configuration

 - NAPTR (RFC3403) RR decoding support

 - new file NOTES which complements TODO somewhat, and includes some
   important shortcomings

 - many internal cleanups, including some preparations for better error
   recovery, security and robustness (and thus API changes)

 - removed some #defines which are now unused (like DNS_MAXSRCH)

 - changed WIN32 to WINDOWS everywhere in preprocessor tests,
   to be able to build it on win64 as well

0.0.8 (12 Sep 2005)

 - added SRV records (rfc2782) parsing,
   thanks to Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo for implementation.

 - bugfixes:
   o use uninitialized value when no reply, library died with assertion:
     assert((status < 0 && result == 0) || (status >= 0 && result != 0)).
   o on some OSes, struct sockaddr_in has additional fields, so
     memcmp'ing two sockaddresses does not work.

 - rblcheck(.1)

0.0.7 (20 Apr 2005)

 - dnsget.1 manpage and several enhancements to dnsget.

 - allow nameserver names for -n option of dnsget.

 - API change: all dns_submit*() routines now does not expect
   last `now' argument, since requests aren't sent immediately
   anymore.

 - API change: different application timer callback mechanism.
   Udns now uses single per-context timer instead of per-query.

 - don't assume DNS replies only contain backward DN pointers,
   allow forward pointers too.  Change parsing API.

 - debianize

0.0.6 (08 Apr 2005)

 - use double sorted list for requests (sorted by deadline).
   This should significantly speed up timeout processing for
   large number of requests.

 - changed debugging interface, so it is finally useable
   (still not documented).

 - dnsget routine is now Officially Useable, and sometimes
   even more useable than `host' from BIND distribution
   (and sometimes not - dnsget does not have -C option
   and TCP mode)

 - Debian packaging in debian/ -- udns is now maintained as a
   native Debian package.

 - alot (and I really mean alot) of code cleanups all over.
