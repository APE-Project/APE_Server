** File:        lazyinit.c
** Description: Testing lazy initialization
**
**      Since you only get to initialize once, you have to rerun the test
**      for each test case. The test cases are numbered. If you want to
**      add more tests, take the next number and add it to the switch
**      statement.
**
**      This test is problematic on systems that don't support the notion
**      of console output. The workarounds to emulate that feature include
**      initializations themselves, which defeats the purpose here.
