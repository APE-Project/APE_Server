/*
 * File: pipepong.c
 *
 * Description:
 * This test runs in conjunction with the pipeping test.
 * The pipeping test creates two pipes and redirects the
 * stdin and stdout of this test to the pipes.  Then the
 * pipeping test writes "ping" to this test and this test
 * writes "pong" back.  Note that this test does not depend
 * on NSPR at all.  To run this pair of tests, just invoke
 * pipeping.
 *
 * Tested areas: process creation, pipes, file descriptor
 * inheritance, standard I/O redirection.
