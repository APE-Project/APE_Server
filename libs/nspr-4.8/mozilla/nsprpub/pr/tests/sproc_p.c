 * Test sproc_p.c
 *
 * The purpose of this test and the sproc_ch.c test is to test the shutdown
 * of all the IRIX sprocs in a program when one of them dies due to an error.
 *
 * In this test, the parent sproc gets a segmentation fault and dies.
 * The child sproc never stops on its own.  You should use "ps" to see if
 * the child sproc is killed after the parent dies.
