/*
 * File: pipepong2.c
 *
 * Description:
 * This test runs in conjunction with the pipeping2 test.
 * The pipeping2 test creates two pipes and passes two
 * pipe fd's to this test.  Then the pipeping2 test writes
 * "ping" to this test and this test writes "pong" back.
 * To run this pair of tests, just invoke pipeping2.
 *
 * Tested areas: process creation, pipes, file descriptor
 * inheritance.
