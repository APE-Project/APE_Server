/* jband - 10/26/98 -  */

js/jsd/jsdb is a console debugger using only native code. It is experimental.
The only makefile supplied is for Win32.

jsdb.mak will build a debugger enabled js/src/js.c shell. The debugger is
implemented by reflecting the JSD api into JavaScript. The actual debugger 
logic is fully implemented in debugger.js. The debugger can debug itself. It
can also be modified and reloaded at runtime.

The JavaScript keyword 'debugger' is used to break into the debugger. A 'help()'
command is supplied to show available commands when execution is stopped.
