/* jband - 09/09/97 - readme for the dreaded js/jsd/corba system */

This stuff in js/jsd/corba/src is used to generate corba source in IDL, Java,
and C++. The raw source is all Java. The 'makefile' is mk.bat which is currently
expected to run only on jband's NT box. All of the important output of this
process should be checked in to cvs. mk.bat is only needed to regenerate new
sources as the interfaces change. Those new sources should then be committed to
cvs.

The main scheme here is to use the Java code in js/jsd/corba/src as idl.
mk.bat uses java2idl, orbeline, and idl2java to generate IDL and stubs and
skeletons in C++ and Java. There are a few hacks to deal with limitations of
these tools.

The C++ output is copied to js/jsd/corba.
The Java output is copied to 
js/jsdj/classes/com/netscape/jsdebugging/remote/corba.

Note that the files:

    StringReciever.java  
    TestInterface.java  
    Thing.java

are used only in test programs and are not part of the product
